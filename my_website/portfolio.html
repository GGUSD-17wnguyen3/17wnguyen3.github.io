                        <p>The purpose of my Fruit Catcher game was to get the highest score<br>
                            possible as there was no way anyone could beat the game.<br>
                            Throughout the code of the game, I used many forever loops<br>
                            to constantly chekc if the user made any movements and used<br>
                            them to make my own interval system. The initial script would keep<br>
                            checking if the user moved the bowl left or right, and it broadcasted<br>
                            a single message that initated another script that would spawn fruits<br>
                            at a certain interval. I made fruits spawn at a certain interval with<br>
                            a forever loop and wait code with a set variable which determined the<br>
                            rate at which fruits spawned. Creating an interval that spawned fruit<br>
                            at a set rate was the most difficult obstacle that I faced because before<br>
                            I used the time variabble that scratch had but it was ery ineffective.<br>
                            instead I created my own way of spawning fruit at a set rate by creating<br>
                            a variable that would store the rate. I would then use forever loops to<br>
                            continuously spawn fruit but the script would wait for the set rate.
